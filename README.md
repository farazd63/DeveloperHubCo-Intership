## Introduction
This report summarizes a series of data science projects aimed at exploring, visualizing, and modeling various datasets. Each task focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of data science principles.

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
### Objective
The objective of this task was to understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset.

### Dataset
- **Iris Dataset** (CSV format, available through seaborn or other open sources)

### Methodology
- Loaded the dataset using the pandas library.
- Displayed the dataset structure using `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`.
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plot to analyze relationships between variables.
  - Histogram to examine data distribution.
  - Box plot to detect outliers and spread of values.

### Results
- The scatter plot revealed relationships between different species of iris based on sepal and petal dimensions.
- The histogram showed the distribution of sepal lengths, indicating a normal distribution.
- The box plot highlighted the presence of outliers in the petal width.

### Skills Developed
- Data loading and inspection using pandas.
- Basic data summarization.
- Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
### Objective
The objective was to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.

### Dataset
- **Loan Prediction Dataset** (available on Kaggle)

### Methodology
- Handled missing data appropriately.
- Visualized key features such as loan amount, education, and income.
- Trained a classification model using Logistic Regression.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

### Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% (insert actual accuracy).
- The confusion matrix indicated the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insights into model performance.

### Skills Developed
- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Binary classification using machine learning.
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy.

## Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)
### Objective
The objective was to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank.

### Dataset
- **Churn Modelling Dataset**

### Methodology
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
- Encoded categorical features such as geography and gender.
- Trained a classification model using Decision Trees.
- Analyzed feature importance to understand what influences churn.

### Results
- The model identified key features influencing customer churn, such as age and account balance.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that geographic location and customer service interactions were significant predictors of churn.

### Skills Developed
- Categorical data encoding (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).
- Supervised classification modeling.
- Understanding and interpreting feature importance.

## Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
### Objective
The objective was to estimate the medical insurance claim amount based on personal data.

### Dataset
- **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**

### Methodology
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict charges.
- Visualized how BMI, age, and smoking status impact insurance charges.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Results
- The model provided insights into how different factors, such as BMI and smoking status, affect insurance claims.
- The MAE was approximately XX (insert actual MAE), and the RMSE was approximately XX (insert actual RMSE).

### Skills Developed
- Regression modeling.
- Feature correlation and visualization.
- Error evaluation using MAE and RMSE.
